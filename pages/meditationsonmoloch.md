Meditations On Moloch: Notes
=============
[Original here](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)

Allen Ginsberg’s famous poem on Moloch:

>What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?
>
>Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!
>
>Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!
>
>Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!
>
>Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!
>
>Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch whose factories dream and croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities!
>
>Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
>
>Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream Angels! Crazy in Moloch! Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!
>
>Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Moloch whom I abandon! Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky!
>
>Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!
>
>They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!
>
>Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the American river!
>
>Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit!
>
>Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the flood! Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years’ animal screams and suicides! Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!
>
>Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! the holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! to solitude! waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street!

What’s always impressed me about this poem is its conception of civilization as an individual entity. You can almost see him, with his fingers of armies and his skyscraper-window eyes.

Many say Moloch represents capitalism. This is definitely a piece of it, even a big piece. But it doesn’t quite fit. Capitalism, whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen? Capitalism in whom I am a consciousness without a body? Capitalism, therefore granite cocks?

Moloch is introduced as the answer to a question – C. S. Lewis’ question in Hierarchy Of Philosophers – what does it? Earth could be fair, and all men glad and wise. Instead we have prisons, smokestacks, asylums. What sphinx of cement and aluminum breaks open their skulls and eats up their imagination?

And Ginsberg answers: Moloch does it.

There’s a passage in the Principia Discordia where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. “Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.”

The Goddess answers: “What is the matter with that, if it’s what you want to do?”

Malaclypse: “But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!”

Goddess: “Oh. Well then stop.”

If everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: “Moloch”. This thought is powerful not because it’s correct – nobody literally thinks an ancient Carthaginian demon causes everything – but because thinking of the system as an agent throws into relief the degree to which the system isn’t an agent.

Nick Bostrom makes a reference to the possibility of a dictatorless dystopia, one that every single participant hates but which nevertheless endures unconquered. It’s not hard to imagine such a state. Imagine a country with two rules: first, every person must spend eight hours a day giving themselves pointless and painful electric shocks. Second, if anyone fails to follow a rule (including this one), or speaks out against it, or fails to enforce it, all citizens must unite to kill that person. Suppose these rules were well-enough established by tradition that everyone expected them to be enforced.

So you shock yourself for eight hours a day, because you know if you don’t everyone else will kill you, because if they don’t, everyone else will kill them, and so on. Every single citizen hates the system, but for lack of a good coordination mechanism it endures. From a god’s-eye-view, we can optimize the system to “everyone agrees to stop doing this at once”, but no one within the system is able to effect the transition without great risk to themselves.

This example feels contrived. So let’s run through some real world examples of similar situations.

1. [The Prisoner’s Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma)
> This time played by two libertarians who keep ending up on defect-defect. There’s a much better outcome available if they could figure out the coordination, but coordination is hard or impossible under some conditions. From a god’s-eye-view, we can agree that cooperate-cooperate is a better outcome than defect-defect, but neither prisoner within the system can make it happen.
>
> (Moloch the incomprehensible prison!)

2. [Dollar Auctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction)
> Imagine I hold an auction, which is a normal auction with the following exceptions: the second highest bidder also has to pay their bid but does not receive anything. Additionally, the bidding is anonymous and bidders cannot communicate. Now suppose I am selling a $10 bill. The bid starts at $1 and can be increased by $1 per bid. 
>
> It is rational to pay $9 for $10, so if people are bidding, we should expect the bidding to reach that high. But wait, there is now someone who bid $8 and would lose $8 if the bidding stops here. If they bid $10 now though, then they don't lose any money, so they do.
>
> But now there is someone with a $9 bid that is about to lose $9. If they bid $11 they will only lose $1 on net. By induction you can show this can continue indefinitely, [and has](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction).
>
> You can take advantage of poor coordination to make someone pay more than $10 for $10. From a god’s-eye-view, clearly people should not pay $10 for $1. From within the system, each individual's decisions were rational.
>
> (Ashcans and unobtainable dollars!)

3. [The Malthusian Trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism#:~:text=This%20event%2C%20called%20a%20Malthusian,resulting%20in%20poverty%20and%20depopulation.)
> Suppose you are one of the first rats introduced onto a pristine island. It is full of yummy plants and you live an idyllic life lounging about, eating, and composing great works of art (you’re from the Redwall series).
>
> You live a long life and have a dozen children. All of them have a dozen children, and so on. In two generations there will be 144 rats. In four generations, twenty thousand, and the island will have reached its carrying capacity. Now there’s not enough food and space to go around. A certain percent of each new generation dies just in order to keep the population steady.
>
> A certain sect of rats abandons art in order to devote more of their time to scrounging for survival. With a bit more food each generation, a bit less of this sect dies than members of the mainstream, until after a while, no rat composes any art at all. Any sect of rats who try to bring it back will slowly die out.
>
> It’s not just art though. Any sect at all that is leaner, meaner, and more survivalist than the mainstream will eventually take over. If one sect of rats altruistically decides to limit its offspring to two per couple in order to decrease overpopulation, that sect now has a massive competitive disadvantage, and will die out. If one sect of rats starts practicing cannibalism, and finds it gives them an advantage, that trait will eventually take over and become common.
>
> If the rat scientists predict that depletion of the island’s nut stores is accelerating at a dangerous rate and they will soon be exhausted completely, a few sects of rats might try to limit their nut consumption to a sustainable level. Those rats will be outcompeted by their more selfish cousins. Eventually the nuts will be exhausted completely, most of the rats will die off, and the cycle will begin again. Any sect of rats advocating some action to stop the cycle will be outcompeted by their cousins for whom advocating _anything_ is a waste of time that could be used to compete and consume.
>
> For a bunch of reasons evolution is not quite as Malthusian as this idealized case, but it provides the prototype example we can apply to other things to see the underlying mechanism. From a god’s-eye-view, it’s easy to say the rats should maintain a comfortably low population. From within the system, each individual rat will follow its genetic imperative and the island will end up in an endless boom-bust cycle.
>
> (Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius!)

4. [Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism)
> Imagine a cutthroat industry. The owner of a company employs workers in a sweatshop to sew garments, which he sells at minimal profit. _Maybe_ he would like to pay his workers more, or give them nicer working conditions, but he can’t. That would raise the price of his products and he would be outcompeted by his cheaper rivals and go bankrupt. Maybe many of his rivals are nice people who would also like to pay their workers more, but unless they have some kind of deal that none of them are going to defect by undercutting their prices they can’t do it. (Even if they did pull this off, it would be violating most countries anti-monopoly laws)
>
> Like the rats, who gradually lose all values except sheer competition, so companies in an economic environment of sufficiently intense competition are forced to abandon all values except optimizing-for-profit or else be outcompeted by companies that optimized for profit better and so can sell the same service at a lower price.
>
> I’m not really sure how widely people appreciate the value of analogizing capitalism to evolution. Fit companies – defined as those that obtain capital – survive, expand, and inspire future efforts, and unfit companies – defined as those that lose capital – go bankrupt and die out. The reasons Nature is tooth and claw are the same reasons the market is ruthless and exploitative.
>
> From a god’s-eye-view, we can contrive a friendly industry where every company pays its workers a living wage. From within the system, there’s no way to enact it.
>
>(Moloch whose blood is running money!)

5. [The Two-Income Trap](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/28/book-review-the-two-income-trap/)
>It has been theorized that sufficiently intense competition for suburban houses _for the sake of being in good school districts_ meant that people had to throw away lots of other values – time at home with their children, financial security – to optimize for house-buying-ability or else be consigned to the ghetto.
>
> From a god’s-eye-view, if everyone agrees not to take on a second job to help win their competition for nice houses, then everyone will get exactly as nice a house and school district as they did before, but only have to work one job. From within the system, absent a government literally willing to ban second jobs, everyone who doesn’t get one will be left behind.
>
>(Robot apartments! Invisible suburbs!)

6. [Agriculture](https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/the-worst-mistake-in-the-history-of-the-human-race)
> Jared Diamond calls it the worst mistake in human history. Whether or not it was a mistake, it wasn’t an accident – agricultural civilizations simply outcompeted nomadic ones.
>
> Maybe hunting and gathering was more enjoyable, higher life expectancy, and more conducive to human flourishing - but in an intense competition, in which agriculture, with all its disease and oppression and pestilence was the more competitive option. Like the rats, it's not like agriculturalists knew what they were doing. Some people farmed, some people foraged, and occasionally they fought over resources. Over thousands of years as populations increased, one strategy survived and one didn't. Tribes all over the world turned to agriculture or died out.

7. [Arms Races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race)
> Large countries can spend anywhere from 5% to 30% of their budget on defense. In the absence of war – a condition which has mostly held for the past fifty years – all this does is sap money away from infrastructure, health, education, or economic growth. But any country that fails to spend enough money on defense risks being invaded by a neighboring country that did. Therefore, almost all countries try to spend some money on defense.
>
> From a god’s-eye-view, the best solution is world peace and no country having an army at all. From within the system, no country can unilaterally enforce that, so their best option is to keep on throwing their money into missiles that lie in silos, unused.
>
>(Moloch the vast stone of war!)

All these scenarios are known as a "race to the bottom". Once one agent learns how to become more competitive by sacrificing a common value, all its competitors must also sacrifice that value or be outcompeted and replaced by the less scrupulous. Therefore, the system is likely to end up with everyone once again equally competitive, but the sacrificed value is gone forever. From a god’s-eye-view, the competitors know they will all be worse off if they try to be more competitive, but from within the system, given insufficient coordination, it’s impossible to avoid.

Before we go on, there’s a slightly different form of situation worth investigating. In this one, the competition is kept at bay by some outside force, like social stigma. As a result, there’s not actually a race to the bottom – the system can continue functioning at a relatively high level – but it’s impossible to optimize and resources are consistently thrown away for no reason. Lest you get exhausted before we even begin, I’ll limit myself to four examples here.

1. Education
>"People ask why we can’t reform the education system. But right now students’ incentive is to go to the most prestigious college they can get into so employers will hire them – whether or not they learn anything. Employers’ incentive is to get students from the most prestigious college they can so that they can defend their decision to their boss if it goes wrong – whether or not the college provides value added. And colleges’ incentive is to do whatever it takes to get more prestige, as measured in US News and World Report rankings – whether or not it helps students. Does this lead to huge waste and poor education? Yes. Could the Education God notice this and make some Education Decrees that lead to a vastly more efficient system? Easily! But since there’s no Education God everybody is just going to follow their own incentives, which are only partly correlated with education or efficiency."
>
>From a god’s eye view, it’s easy to say things like “Students should only go to college if they think they will get something out of it, and employers should hire applicants based on their competence and not on what college they went to”. From within the system, everyone’s already following their own incentives correctly, so unless the incentives change the system won’t either.

2. Science
> The modern research community knows they aren’t producing the best science they could be. There’s lots of publication bias, statistics are done in a confusing and misleading way out of sheer inertia, and replications often happen very late or not at all. And sometimes someone will say something like “I can’t believe people are too dumb to fix Science. All we would have to do is require early registration of studies to avoid publication bias, turn this new and powerful statistical technique into the new standard, and accord higher status to scientists who do replication experiments. It would be really simple and it would vastly increase scientific progress. I must just be smarter than all existing scientists, since I’m able to think of this and they aren’t.”
>
>And yeah. That would work for the Science God. He could just make a Science Decree that everyone has to use the right statistics, and make another Science Decree that everyone must accord replications higher status.
>
>But things that work from a god’s-eye view don’t work from within the system. No individual scientist has an incentive to unilaterally switch to the new statistical technique for her own research, since it would make her research less likely to produce earth-shattering results and since it would just confuse all the other scientists. They just have an incentive to want everybody else to do it, at which point they would follow along. And no individual journal has an incentive to unilaterally switch to early registration and publishing negative results, since it would just mean their results are less interesting than that other journal who only publishes ground-breaking discoveries. From within the system, everyone is following their own incentives and will continue to do so.

3. Government corruption
>I don’t know of anyone who really thinks, in a principled way, that corporate welfare is a good idea. But the government still manages to spend somewhere around (depending on how you calculate it) $100 billion dollars a year on it – which for example is three times the amount they spend on health care for the needy. Everyone familiar with the problem has come up with the same easy solution: stop giving so much corporate welfare. Why doesn’t it happen?
>
>Government are competing against one another to get elected or promoted. And suppose part of optimizing for electability is optimizing campaign donations from corporations – or maybe it isn’t, but officials think it is. Officials who try to mess with corporate welfare may lose the support of corporations and be outcompeted by officials who promise to keep it intact.
>
>So although from a god’s-eye-view everyone knows that eliminating corporate welfare is the best solution, each individual official’s personal incentives push her to maintain it.




A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don’t take it die out. Eventually, everyone’s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone’s absolute status is worse than before. The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been.

In the first set of scenarios, the system continues "optimizing" because there is still more to do, discarding anything that doesn't improve competitiveness.

In the second set of scenarious, the system has already optimized all it can and has reached an equilibrium point that is _sort of close_ to something we wanted. In these, the combined push and pull of incentives equal out at some particular point, and the system stops "moving" in any direction. That point isn't necessarily exactly where we wanted it though.

Every two-bit author and philosopher has to write their own utopia. Most of them are legitimately pretty nice. In fact, it’s a pretty good bet that two utopias that are polar opposites both sound better than our own world.
